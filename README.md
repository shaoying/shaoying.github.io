Machine Learning Projects, iOS App Development Projects

# [Project 1: Banking Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis](https://github.com/shaoying/ML_Supervised_Learning_Project) 
* Developed algorithms to predict customer churn probability based on labeled data via Python programming
* Preprocessed data set by data cleaning, categorical feature transformation, and standardization
* Trained supervised machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors, and applied regularization with optimal parameters to overcome overfitting
* Evaluated model performance and analyzed feature importance to identify top factors that influenced the results

# [Project 2: The Complete iOS App Development](https://github.com/shaoying/swift-code) 
* Dicee
* Magic 8 Ball
* Xylophone (Music App)
* Quizzer
* Calculator (Only Design part)      
* The Weather App 'Clima'
